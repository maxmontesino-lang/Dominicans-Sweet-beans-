      The reason they are prepared during Lent and Holy Week is mainly because these legumes are harvested in spring, making them an abundant food during this time. The first written mention of sweet beans dates back to 1929, in a book by Ramón Emilio Jiménez titled Al amor del bohío, which says:

      But the favorite dish of Lent is sweet beans, essential on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and Holy Friday. The rich grain receives, in the torture of the pot, a bath of water, snowy milk reinforced with one of coconut and another of sugar, and to these are added the ingredients butter, diced sweet potato to thicken, cream enriched with raisins and spices, and finally the casabe, the typical casabe that is reserved to be thrown in pieces over the steaming platters at the decisive moment of the attack.

       Dominican sweet beans are not just about tradition, it's about sharing; your friends, neighbors, and coworkers will always do their best to make sure that no one around them goes without tasting sweet beans during Holy Week. Dominican sweet beans are usually made in very large quantities and shared among relatives and friends. I’ve seen people make enough of this dessert to feed entire neighborhoods—and they usually do share it with everyone around them!

    <p>Among Dominicans, there is always a debate when it comes to sweet beans since there are people who like to liquefy the beans so that it has a creamy texture, and there is another group that, although they do the same, leaves some beans in the cream. In my case, I will eat both anyway. Which one sounds better to you?</p>

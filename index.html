      <h1>Dominican Sweet Beans</h1>
      <p>Sweet beans are a typical dessert of the Dominican Republic that is usually eaten during Lent and Holy Week. It consists of a semi-liquid cream made from beans (also known as 'porotos' or 'habichuelas'), sweetened, flavored with cinnamon and other spices, and topped with milk cookies or cassava. Additionally, coconut milk, evaporated milk, and sweet potato are added to provide a creamy texture.</p>
      <p>It is considered one of the most representative dishes of Dominican cuisine. In the northern part of the Dominican Republic (Cibao), as well as in the capital, this dessert is usually prepared with red beans, while in the south, they make 'habas con dulce', made with white beans. In the southwest, a very similar dessert called 'candolias' is prepared.</p>
      <p>Nothing says Cuaresma in a Dominican household quite like a warm pot of Habichuelas con Dulce simmering on the stove. I grew up watching my family make this beloved dessert every year, and now, it’s one of my favorite traditions to share. That first creamy, spiced spoonful instantly brings back memories of childhood. </p>
